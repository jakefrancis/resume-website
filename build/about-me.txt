I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for code.

Currently I work as a Senior Chemistry Technician at D.C. Cook Nuclear power station ☢️.
My passions include, programming, art, photography, and science. I hold a B.S. in Chemistry from Doane University. 
(Although I took almost as many Art Courses as Chemistry courses) 
I have an unquenchable thirst for new information, and consider myself a life long learner. Unlike anything else I have studied programming has given me the perfect union of creativity, and analytical problem sovling. 
I simply can't get enough.
